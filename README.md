# HTML in Elm

Create composable widgets with the full power of HTML and CSS. This library
lets you:

  * Render really freakin' fast 
  * Reuse existing CSS
  * Use all the latest standards, such as [flexbox][]

[flexbox]: (http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

[Embedding Elm widgets](https://github.com/evancz/elm-html-and-js) in existing
applications and [JS interop](http://elm-lang.org/learn/Ports.elm) are both
really easy, so this library takes the next logical step in improving Elm's
interop story.
