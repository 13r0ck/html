# HTML in Elm

Blazing fast HTML *and* all of the benefits of Elm.

Read more about how this library works and how to use it in [this post][html].

### Get Started

Once you have the [Elm Platform][platform], use [elm-get][get] to download
elm-html. The commands would be something like this:

[platform]: https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform#elm-platform
[get]: https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-get#use

```
mkdir myProject
cd myProject
elm-get install evancz/elm-html
```

After that you will be able to use anything described in [the
documentation][docs].

Another way to get started is to fork the [elm-todomvc project][todomvc] and
work from there. This will also give you a reasonable architecture for your
project.

### Example

Try out [TodoMVC written in Elm][demo]. Check out the [source code][src]. It
cannot get much simpler than that.

### Performance

[The benchmarks][bench] show that elm-html is really fast when compared to
other popular alternatives.
